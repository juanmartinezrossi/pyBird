2. MutableMapping error: Dronekit is not compatible with python versions after 3.10.
    solution: find the directory where the dronekit library is installed in your raspberry pi with:
        pip show dronekit
    e.g.: /usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/dronekit
    do:
        sudo nano dronekit

        Replace: collections
        With:   collections.abc
    do not further update all libraries after this. If you do, repeat this process.
